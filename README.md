Quick mobile front end
The exercise of this project was to create a complete CRUD front end and back end under an hour
Backend project is on a different repository and I used .net core 5
Front end tech used on this project: ReactNative
Since the project was meant to be created under an hour, there is a lot of best practice that i couldn't introduce
the goal was to introduce a proper a proper architecture/Front and Back
